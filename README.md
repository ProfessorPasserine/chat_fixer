# chat_fixer
Extensions for fixing the issues with the current sf chat frontend.

This extension also ships with a cache buster that ensures that you will show new 
images as soon as the server rotates them.

More browser support will come as will other features. Please note this extension is not without bugs.
We are also implementing a new chat system soon and thus this is only a temporary fix. Upon release of the new
chat system, this extension will be removed.

## Current Supported Browsers
